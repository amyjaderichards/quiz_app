# quiz_app
A simple multiple-choice quiz app built using [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-quiz-app-with-html-css-and-javascript/) tutorial. A Fetch API is used to load questions from a Trivia API, high scores are stored in local storage and elements such a progress bar for questions and a spinning loader are used.

I have extended the project through offering a topic choice page, allowing the player to select from a different set of questions pulled from the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/)
